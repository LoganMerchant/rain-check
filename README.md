# RainCheck: A Weather Dashboard

## Purpose
Allows a user to search for a city in order to see it's current weather conditions, as well as a 5-day forecast. This is a particularly useful application for any individual planning a trip.

## Process & Reflection
I began this project by setting us the initial layout of the forecast, current conditions, and search history. I then began to work on each section individually, calling from Open Weather Map's API when needed. I then styled any remaining parts that needed some brushing up. 
</br>
This was a fun project and I certainly can't wait to work with more APIs in the future. Open Weather's documentation was easy to understand and a thorough. I have some more features for this application that I'd like to add in the future, such as displaying the city's timezone.
