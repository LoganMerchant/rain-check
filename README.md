## Purpose

Built with travel in mind, this application is perfect for anyone looking to plan around the weather as they travel to any city around the globe. With that being said, it can also be useful for anyone to check the weather before they go to work, visit loved ones, etc.

## Process

I began this project by setting us the initial layout of the forecast, current conditions, and search history. I then began to work on each section individually, calling from Open Weather Map's API when needed. I then styled any remaining parts that needed some brushing up.

## Reflection

This was a fun project and I certainly can't wait to work with more APIs in the future. Open Weather's documentation was easy to understand and a thorough. I have some more features for this application that I'd like to add in the future, such as displaying the city's timezone.
